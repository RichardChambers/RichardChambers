👋 This is the personal repository for @RichardChambers which I use for various personal projects and explorations. I also use this
to clone projects I find interesting and want to look into further.

👀 My interests vary but mostly concentrate on Windows applications and microcontrollers. My background is C and C++ however I've also
spent time with web applications using php as well as some Go programming.

I enjoy writing and here are two platforms I use:
 - Stack Overflow - https://stackoverflow.com/users/1466970/richard-chambers
 - Code Project - https://www.codeproject.com/Members/Richard-Chambers
